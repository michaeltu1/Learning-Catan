# Learning Catan
Current work in progress! :stuck_out_tongue:

### General Project Goals
- [ ] Develop a Java implementation of Catan
- [ ] Create AI bots with varying difficulty levels and strategies
- [ ] Design an after game report
- [ ] Allow different game modes (random board, custom board ... )
- [ ] Add in graphics

#### Project Notes
- Use backtracking search to enforce 6's and 8's can't be next to each other on the board
- Make AI bots implement a version of expectimax search with chance node probabilities set by player skill level
- Board backed with an arraylist of 19 tile class objects
- Random board construction successful
- Working on implementing turn interactions (Game class)
